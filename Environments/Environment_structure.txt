Rules:
    -All non-required functions should only be used internally and should start with an underscore.
    -Use underscore for separating out any multi-worded (function, variable, ect.) name
    -Required functions should be at the bottom of the class.

Required functions:
    -reset():
        Reset all game variables (ball position, player position, ect.) except for statistic variables (score)
    -observe():
        Return the input to the model as an array. This can be dependent on variables defined on environment creation.
        For example the output could just be the relevant variables of the game or it could be the full game screen.
    -act(action):
        "action" is an element of [0, num_actions). action is always determined randomly or by argmax of the
        model.predict(env.observe())[0] array
        Must return: 1) observe() after updating the state, 2) reward, 3) boolean valued variable game_over
    -statistics():
        Environment dependent information about the games that have passed up to this point in training or testing.
        Usually includes number of wins for games.
        Must return a string, prefer the format of "stat1 value1 | stat2 value2 | stat3 value3 ..."
    -reset_score():
        Any game statistics that are not reset by reset() and are used by statistics() should be reset here.
    -draw_state():
        Returns a numpy 2D array with integers representing the environment. Will be made a grayscale image.
